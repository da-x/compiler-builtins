//! This module defines the `__rust_probestack` intrinsic which is used in the
//! implementation of "stack probes" on certain platforms.
//!
//! The purpose of a stack probe is to provide a static guarantee that if a
//! thread has a guard page then a stack overflow is guaranteed to hit that
//! guard page. If a function did not have a stack probe then there's a risk of
//! having a stack frame *larger* than the guard page, so a function call could
//! skip over the guard page entirely and then later hit maybe the heap or
//! another thread, possibly leading to security vulnerabilities such as [The
//! Stack Clash], for example.
//!
//! [The Stack Clash]: https://blog.qualys.com/securitylabs/2017/06/19/the-stack-clash
//!
//! The `__rust_probestack` is called in the prologue of functions whose stack
//! size is larger than the guard page, for example larger than 4096 bytes on
//! x86. This function is then responsible for "touching" all pages relevant to
//! the stack to ensure that that if any of them are the guard page we'll hit
//! them guaranteed.
//!
//! The precise ABI for how this function operates is defined by LLVM. There's
//! no real documentation as to what this is, so you'd basically need to read
//! the LLVM source code for reference. Often though the test cases can be
//! illuminating as to the ABI that's generated, or just looking at the output
//! of `llc`.
//!
//! Note that `#[naked]` is typically used here for the stack probe because the
//! ABI corresponds to no actual ABI.
//!
//! Finally it's worth noting that at the time of this writing LLVM only has
//! support for stack probes on x86 and x86_64. There's no support for stack
//! probes on any other architecture like ARM or PowerPC64. LLVM I'm sure would
//! be more than welcome to accept such a change!

// The code here moved to probestack_*.S, to support debugger frame information.
